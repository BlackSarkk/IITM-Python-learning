- range(10)     : 0 - 9
- range(1, 10)  : 1 - 9
- range(-2)     : loop wont exectute (will not show any error, hard to debug)

- Use "while" only when the number of iterations is indefinite.
- If you can term the steps as do n times, do once for each item, etc. use "for" loop instead.
- If you can only term the steps as do until something happens. Like when user inputs 10. A bit of wisdom 📖 There are maily two ways in which while loops are used in the context of taking inputs until a terminal word.
- 1. while a != terminal_word: # opposite of the terminal condition
- 2. while True:               # loop forever


- nums = list(map(int, input().split()))      # Taking int list as input

- range(..., ..., -1) ,  "str"[::-1]    negative steps in both works the same way
