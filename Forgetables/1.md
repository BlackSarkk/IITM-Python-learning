# W-1

- / always gives float
- print(1, 2) => (,) adds a single space while printing
- calculation with a float always gives float
- by default input() takes string even if the input is int

- 2 ** 3 ** 0  => 2          : In case of exponential operation the operation goes from right to left
- x = y = 3    => x=3, y=3   : In case of assignment operator, the operation goes from right to left

- "st" * 2  = stst (st)
- '5' * 2.0 = error
- '5' + 2   = error
- "5" > "2" = true (convert to ascii)
- X or Y → returns X if X is truthy, otherwise returns Y
- A and B → if A is falsy, return A; otherwise return B
- 5 == 5 and 2 => returns 2 (int)
- 555[2]    => false coz integer isnt iteratable
- True * 1  => 1 (int)
- True + 1  => 2 (int)
- // has higher presidence than /
- word1 < word2 and word1 < word3  # bool: True if word1 comes before word2 and word3 assume all words are different
- output1 = " ".join([word1, word2]) # str: join word1 and word2 with space in between
- "h" in word1 # bool: True if word1 has the letter h
- ends_with_a = word1.endswith(("a", "A")) # bool: True if word1 ends with letter a or A

- input().strip()   : This will make sure there is no leading/trailing whitespaces


- any(iterable) → returns True if at least one element in the iterable is truthy (i.e., evaluates to True). Otherwise, it returns False.

if any(c in "aeiou" for c in text):
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
