# s='0123456789'

# a=s[4]
# b=s[7]
# print(a+b)      # 47, coz it is a string as s is in string

# a=int(s[4])
# b=int(s[7])       
# print(a+b)      # 11, coz now it gets converted into integer

# a=s[3]
# b=s[8]
# n=int(a+b)      
# print(n)          # 38, coz in n, it is first concatinating and then storing as int
