# print(type(n))      # will print the type of n => int

# print(type(s))      # will print the type of s => string
# print(type(l))      # will print the type of l => list
# print(l[0])         # will print the first element of l => 10
# print(type(l[0]))   # will print the type of the first element of l => int
# print(type(b))      # will print the type of b => bool
