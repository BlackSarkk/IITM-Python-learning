# ********** Lec 9 [ Operators I ]

# n=3*2.6
# a=1
# b=2.28
# m=a+b         # 3.28
# ? This works fine


# a="rahul"
# b="india"
# n=a*b
# ? This throws an error (as it dosent know how to use '*' operators in strings)


# a="rahul"
# b="india"
# n=a+b          # rahulindia
# ? This works fine (Concatination)
# ? It is programmed in such a way for convinience


# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [7, 9, 15]
# n = a+b        # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# ? This works fine (concatinate the lists)


# a=11
# b=15
# n=a/b          # 0.7333 (float)
# n=a//b         # only the integer part i.e. 0
# ? This works fine (division)


# n = 10+13*2    # 10 * (13 + 2) = 36
# ? It is due to Operator precedence: BODMAS
