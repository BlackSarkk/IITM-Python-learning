'''
A sequence of n terms (a1,a2,…,an)(a1,a2,…,an) is called an Arithmetic progression (AP) if the difference between any two consecutive terms stays constant. That is:

a2−a1=a3−a2=⋯=an−a(n−1)=d  
Some useful terms:

a1 is the first term of the AP.
d is called the common difference of the AP.
n is the total number of terms in the AP.

Write a function named write_AP that accepts the following arguments:

a_1: first term of the AP, integer.
d: common difference of the AP, integer.
n: number of terms in the AP, positive integer.
Within the function, create a file named out.txt and write the first 
n terms of the AP to it, one term on each line, starting from the first term.

You do not have to accept input from the console or print the output. You have to write the function definition. Within the function, create the file named out.txt.
